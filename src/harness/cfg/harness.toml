# This file contains the configuration options for the test harness.
# The configuration is divided into three sections: top-level, [tests] and [paths].
# Details of the options in each section are provided below the header for each section
# (when present).
#
# By default, optional entires are commented out (#); to modify, remove the # at the start
# of the line and update the placeholder value.
#
# Unless noted otherwise, any paths may be specified as an absolute or a relative path.
# If relative, path is interpreted relative to the test harness working directory
# (typically src/harness).

# Top-level Options:
#   sut_config - Path to config file with details on connecting to AFC SUT. Should be a
#                valid TOML config file.

sut_config = 'cfg/afc.toml'

[tests]
# Specifies the python function that provides the list of tests to be run.
# Options:
#   module - Module path for the test_to_run function, specified in python package notation
#            (i.e., folder separator is '.', not '/'). Specified path must be found within
#            the python system path at runtime. This (typically) includes paths relative to
#            test_main.py (src/harness). For more info on the python system path,
#            see https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys_path_init.html
#   list_func - Name of the python function with module that provides a list of tests to be
#               executed by the test harness.

#module = 'cfg.tests_to_run'
#list_func = 'tests_to_run'

# Path configuration for harness input/output
[paths]
# Specifies the input and output directories used by the test harness.
# Options:
#   inquiry_dir - Path to the directory containing the available spectrum inquiry requests for
#                 each test
#   response_dir - Path where received inquiry responses will be stored after receipt from the AFC
#   mask_dir - Path to the directory containing the expected inquiry responses for each test
#   log_dir = Path where test harness output will be logged during execution

#inquiry_dir = 'test_vectors/latest/inquiries'
#response_dir = 'test_vectors/latest/responses'
#mask_dir = 'test_vectors/latest/masks'
#log_dir = 'logs'
